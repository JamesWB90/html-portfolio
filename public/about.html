<h2> About Me</h2>
<h4>This is me</h4>

<p> I have not come to be a Web Development / UX designer taking the path of university or studies. It is
  something I discovered later in life.

  I studied music technology at university, after which I worked in a few studios, film sets, and a
  computer retail store.

  I then moved on to work as an office admin and project manager for a property development company, where
  I have worked for the last six years as a side project with this company. I also helped set up and
  helped manage a local coffee shop. Also, having a hand in helping create the branding and logo design
  for the coffee shop led me to discover UX/UI design and gain an understanding of the principles used in
  creating a good experience for the user.

  Following this, I did some self-study by reading about UX principles using Figma and starting a Coursera
  (Foundations in user Experience course). I have obtained the first certificate, and I'm still working
  through the course in my own time.

  Moreover, for 12 weeks, I joined a Web Development Bootcamp with 'Baths Spa University.' to learn to
  code, as I have always had an interest in coding and had done a little in the past but never enough to
  pursue a career in it. The course covered the basics of front-end development.
  <br> <br>
  Using
  HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, ES6, SASS, BOOTSTRAP, NODE JS and REACT<br><br>

  Throughout the 12 weeks, we had a variety of tasks and projects to complete, finishing with a portfolio
  website to showcase the skills we had learnt. I know I have much more to learn. However, I feel I am
  ready to get my foot in the door and start a career in the tech industry.

  I have always loved dealing with customers and clients working with others, ensuring I could offer them
  the best product that suits their needs or find the best solution to solve an issue they may have. Tech,
  UX and Web Development are a part of the world and even more now in how we use technology today, and I
  would like to contribute my knowledge to the industry.

  Outside work and studies, I go to the gym, cycle, play the guitar, and attend motorsport track days in a
  car I built with my brothers.
  Play videogames. I have had the opportunity to be able to travel throughout my life, including New
  Zealand, Australia, Thailand, America, and Europe. So I'm done with travelling. However still partial to
  a lovely holiday with my family once in a while. I also have two kids that keep me busy.
